- Color scheme on join us page
- a resources section on all of their course pages
- drop down menu (just the ability to make one)
- possibly login system for asynchronous classes (donâ€™t need to attend zoom, just work on stuff through website)
- Better Loading times (possibly bad because code runs through a website builder)
