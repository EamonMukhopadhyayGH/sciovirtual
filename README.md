Webdev meeting summary:
They use a website builder called host gator website builder.
They want us to increase responsiveness of their website - transitions, animations, making it look good on a phone, ect. as well as streamlining the editing process - takes too long to edit each page individually.

Conclusion is from both of us is to edit code with HTML/CSS, not using the website builder.
From my first glance, I only saw the option to add new HTML code. 
I didn’t see any opition to edit their existing website with HTML/CSS.
Thus, it seems like we would to have recode the entire website, or at least the pages they want us to edit.
Recode includes copying and pasting what we know from inspecting, but its pretty much unreadable.  Hostgator uses its own css rules and it would take a long time to learn all of them

Some specific things they have in mind, although they still need to talk about changes they want:
- Color scheme on join us page
- a resources section on all of their course pages
- drop down menu (just the ability to make one)
- possibly login system for asynchronous classes (don’t need to attend zoom, just work on stuff through website)
- Better Loading times (possibly bad because code runs through a website builder)
I said with our skills we could help them with first 3, and possibly the last. It would just resolve by use editing the code.
